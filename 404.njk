    <h1>Whoops! Content not found.</h1>
    <h1>But we did find this cute crab.</h1>

    <p>This crab is named, Ferris, and they are the unofficial mascot of the Rust Community. Many Rust programmers call themselves “Rustaceans,” a play on the word “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean">crustacean</a>.” We refer to Ferris with the pronouns “they,” “them,” etc., rather than with gendered pronouns.</p>
    <p>Ferris is a name playing off of the adjective, “ferrous,” meaning of or pertaining to iron. Since Rust often forms on iron, it seemed like a fun origin for our mascot’s name!</p>
    <p>You can find more images of Ferris on <a href="https://rustacean.net/">rustacean.net</a>.
